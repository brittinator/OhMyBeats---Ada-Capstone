# Oh My Beats Product Plan - Brittany L. Walentin

## Overview
Oh My Beats is a wearable technology that will compliment any person who wants to share their music with people in a novel way.  Oh My Beats aims to be a gender neutral accessory so as to be an inclusive as possible.

This project is a top hat that will display a live-view of your music using LEDs. the LEDs will show up as equalizer bars, and will have the ability to change color.

## Target Audience
- Primarily, myself.  I love music, costuming, and programming and want to combine them all.
- Festival-goers, ravers, people who want a novel costume
- Unmet Need: A costume with a light component
- Unmet Need: A interactive wearable piece of hardware that will respond to input

## Specifications
- version 1.0 will be gender neutral in the form of a hat to have the largest user base
- Top Hat with bars of RGB LEDs lining the front of the hat.
- Input of music will be transfered via bluetooth to the hat's microcontroller, and translated into a visual equalizer.
- version 1.1 (stretch goal) will include more inputs from other sources: weather, moon phase, using APIs already out there.
- version 2.0 could be an LED skirt/kilt - now with more LEDs!

### Features
**Proof of Concept (POC)** step will display dots on a computer monitor when music is played. These dots will each represent a single LED position.

These features will address the user's needs
- wearable item of clothing that when hooked up, will light up
- these lights will coorespond to a music input from an external website
- this website will utilize Echo Nest's API
- stretch goal: incorporate weather.com API to include data mundging for weather forecast (sun for sunny, cloud for cloudy, rain for rainy)

### Learning Goals
There are two main camps the learning goals land in: hardware and software.

* Hardware Goals
  * Understanding power requirements for various parts

* Software Goals
  * Low level programming in C

I will also have to learn how to test my hardware and software individually, and as a unit.

### Timeline
Week 1
  - Idea for capstone
  - Product hardware research
  - Product software/API research
  - Deliverable October 2nd: Idea

Week 2
  - Nail down hardware
  - Play with API or sound equalizer transformations
  - Deliverable October 9th:
    * product plan
    * lights on order (done)
    * microprocessor on order (done)
    * any adapters/shields (wifi/bluetooth) on order (done - all-in-one so unneccessary)

Week 3
  - eta for microprocessor is Monday
  - begin work with Echo Nest API or sound algorithms
  - determine how going to get name/artist from spotify to spit out segment data
  - Deliverable October 16th:
    * rough draft mundging music into dots on screen representing LEDs
    * test out microprocessor and bluetooth functionality

Week 4
  - continue working making API into dots
  - do baby step microprocessor + LEDs project
  - begin to incorporate LEDs into the mix
  - Deliverable October 23rd:
    * Ability to show LEDs lighting up when microcontroller directly plugged into laptop (vampiric power)

Week 5 - Final Week
  - Deliverable October 30th: Final product for demo
