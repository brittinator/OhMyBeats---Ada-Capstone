### Timeline
Week 1
  - Idea for capstone
  - Product hardware research
  - Product software/API research
  - Deliverable October 2nd: Idea

Week 2
  - Nail down hardware
  - Play with API or sound equalizer transformations
  - Deliverable October 9th:
    * product plan
    * lights on order (done)
    * microprocessor on order (done)
    * any adapters/shields (wifi/bluetooth) on order (done - all-in-one so unneccessary)

Week 3
  - x eta for microprocessor is Monday
  - x LEDs will also probably be delivered sometime this week
  - x begin work with Echo Nest API or sound algorithms
  - determine how going to get name/artist from spotify to spit out segment data
  - x do baby step microprocessor + LEDs project to get feet wet
  - Deliverable October 16th:
    * Software: rough draft munging short music notes or chords into dots on screen representing LEDs
    * x Hardware: test out microprocessor and bluetooth functionality, and lights if available

Week 4
  - continue working making music into dots
  - begin to incorporate LEDs into the mix
  - Deliverable October 23rd:
    * Ability to show LEDs lighting up when microcontroller directly plugged into laptop (vampiric power)

Week 5 - Final Week
  - Deliverable October 30th: Final product for demo
