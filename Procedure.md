## Materials
* 1 M x Adafruit NeoPixel Digital RGB LED Strip - Black 60 LED (BLACK) [ID:1461] (http://www.adafruit.com/products/1461) - $24.95 USD
* RedBearLab Blend Micro (http://store.redbearlab.com/products/blendmicro) - $26.90 USD

NeoPixels are Adafruit's house brand of Red Green Blue (RGB) LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) that are also addressable.  This means the pixels know their location, which makes programming what you want to display a little easier.

The Blend Micro is an Arduino microcontroller that also houses an on-board bluetooth chip.  The micro utilizes bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy, (BLE) which makes this board not as power hungry as some other arduino shields or raspberry pi dongles. The micro-controller unit (MCU) is Atmel ATmega32U4 and the BLE chip is Nordic nRF8001.
